# Bubble-Party

![](images/game_image.png)

This is a game that engages user to "shoot" bubbles to gain score points. Game starts off with a single player. Bubbles of different color start continuously growing from the top of the game area. Player needs to hit bubbles that are adjacent to 2 or more bubbles of the same color.

I built the game using JavaScript, Canvas, HTML5, CSS3, Firebase, Webpack.

Here are the **MVPs**:
* Start, quit game at any time
* Be able to shoot bubbles
* Have accumulative score system
* Three or more adjacent bubbles of the same color create a cluster and drop if one of them is shot
* Game is over when main mass of bubbles reaches the bottom of the game area
* Option to play sound effects or to mute them
* Have a production ReadMe file
