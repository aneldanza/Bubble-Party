# Bubble-Party

There is a new version of Bubble Party game now! [Bubble Party 2.0](https://github.com/aneldanza/bubble-party-2.0)

This is a game that engages user to "shoot" bubbles to gain score points. Game starts off with a single player. Bubbles of different color start continuously growing from the top of the game area. Player needs to hit bubbles that are adjacent to 2 or more bubbles of the same color.

I built the game using JavaScript, Canvas, HTML5, CSS3, Webpack.

Here are the **MVPs**:

- Start, quit game at any time
- Be able to shoot bubbles
- Have accumulative score system
- Three or more adjacent bubbles of the same color create a cluster and drop if one of them is shot
- Game is over when main mass of bubbles reaches the bottom of the game area
- Option to play sound effects or to mute them
- Have a production ReadMe file
